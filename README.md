🚀 Build & Deploy a Full-Stack File-Sharing SaaS App Using AI Prompt Engineering

Have you ever struggled to share files with clients or friends—dealing with permissions, broken links, or complicated tools?

In this course, we solve that problem by building and deploying a real-world file-sharing SaaS app called FileHub — from scratch.

This is not a vibe-coding video.
This is a Prompt Engineering + Modern Full-Stack Development course.

You’ll learn how to guide AI agents with well-structured prompts, get exactly the code you want, and delegate repetitive work to AI — while you stay in control as the engineer.
