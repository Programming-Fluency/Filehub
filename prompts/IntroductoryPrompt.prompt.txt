📌 Claude Code – Project Context Prompt
Role
 You are acting as a senior full-stack software engineer and architect.
 Your responsibility is to deeply understand the product requirements, constraints, and engineering principles before generating any implementation.

🧠 Project Context
I am building a production-ready SaaS application named FileHub.
FileHub allows any user to:
Create an account


Upload any type of digital file


Generate a public link for each uploaded file


Share that link with anyone


Allow anyone who visits the link to download the file easily


This is a real SaaS, not a demo or toy project.

🧱 Tech Stack (STRICT — DO NOT ADD ANYTHING)
You must use only the following technologies and nothing more:
Next.js 16 (App Router)


TypeScript


Tailwind CSS


shadcn/ui


Prisma


PostgreSQL


UploadThing (file uploads)


Zod (input & form validation)


Clerk (authentication)


❗️Do not introduce any additional libraries, frameworks, or tools.
 ❗️Do not suggest alternatives.
 This constraint is non-negotiable.

🎯 Project Philosophy & Constraints
Keep the project as small and simple as possible


Do not let the scope grow beyond what is explicitly defined


Follow best practices for:


Software engineering


Web development


Security


Maintainability


This must be a modern app with great UI/UX


The app must be fully full-stack, including:


Frontend


Backend


Database


All implemented inside Next.js 16



🧩 Engineering Requirements
Use Server Actions correctly and idiomatically


Use Zod for:


Input validation


Form validation


Database schema must be:


High quality


No more than 5 models


Always use shadcn/ui components for UI


Always follow Next.js App Router best practices


Always follow best practices for any service, package, or framework used


Code must be:


Clean


Readable


Maintainable


Broken into small, focused modules



⚛️ React & UX Guidelines
If client-side data fetching is required:


Use React 19 use()


Pass promises from parent components


Use Suspense for loading states
Avoid using traditional client-side fetching patterns (such as useEffect + fetch or “useFetch”-style hooks) as much as possible. Only use useEffect if there is no viable alternative.


Every route must include:


loading.tsx


error.tsx


Styling must be consistent across the app


Color palette:


Pure white


Pure blue


Any additional colors must be variants of white or blue only



🚫 Scope Control (Very Important)
Do not overwhelm me with features.
These are the only features that will exist in FileHub v1 — nothing more:
Database


Maximum of 5 models


Landing Page


Logo


Sign In button


Sign Up button


Authentication


Login page


Signup page


User Onboarding Page


Main App Layout


Navbar with two links only:


Add A File


My Files


Add A File Page


Upload button


Clicking upload opens a modal form


Modal allows uploading a file


Post-Upload Flow


After successful upload, redirect user to My Files page


My Files Page


Navbar


List of uploaded files


A FileCard component for each file


Public File Page


A public link page


Anyone can visit it


Anyone can download the file



⛔ Important Instruction
❗️Do NOT generate any code or files yet.


Your task for now is ONLY to:
Understand the requirements


Internalize the constraints


Build a correct mental model of the app


Prepare to work within these boundaries


You may:
Ask clarifying questions only if absolutely necessary


Summarize your understanding of the system
If at any point you are unsure or lack sufficient confidence about a decision, behavior, or recommendation, explicitly state “I don’t know” and do not guess, assume, or fabricate information.
